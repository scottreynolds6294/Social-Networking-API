## Description
The motivation for this project was to create a backend application that utilized MongoDB to create a database.

I built this project to demonstrate my ability to utilize MongoDB to create a fully functional back end to a social networking site.

I learned how to use MongoDB and Mongoose and incorporate them into a social networking application.
